# PhpNuget Server

## Purpose

This is born to have my personal repository for nuget, on my cheapo PHP hosting.
With support for complex OData queries.

Verified on:

* PHP 5.3.17-IIS 7
* PHP 5.3.21-IIS 7
* PHP 5.5.8-Apache 2.0 (Windows 8 Pro)
* PHP 5.6-IIS 8
* PHP 5.4.2-Apache 2.0 (OpenSuse 13.1)
* PHP 5.3.3-Apache 2.2 (CentOS 6.5)
* PHP 7.0.14-Apache 2.4 (Windows 10 Home)

## Installation

### Notes for everybody

* When installing the MySql version the db must be present with the user configured!
* The module php_curl must be present and configured inside the php.ini

### Notes for Apache With Red Hat Linux

On Red Hat Linux the mod_rewrite must be enabled on the application directory
since most features depends on it. This can be achieved modifying

	/etc/httpd/conf/http.conf
	
Then on the definition of the phpnuget directory, change the AllowOverride from "None"
to "All"

From:

<pre class="brush: xml;">
	<Directory "/var/www/html/phpnugetdir">
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
		AllowOverride None
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
</pre>

To:

<pre class="brush: xml;">
	<Directory "/var/www/html/phpnugetdir">
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
</pre>

And then restart Apache

	sudo service httpd restart
	
This should be enough to let everything works

### Notes for Apache on Windows

If php is unable to load curl-related functions copy the following files from the php directory to "C:\Windows\System".
You can verify this by downloading a file from the official nuget repository via the manage packages page.

* libeay32.dll
* libsasl.dll
* ssleay32.dll
* libssh2

### Prerequisites For IIS

These steps are NOT needed if your hosting already configured PHP

* Create the website with a standard web.config
* Install PHP for IIS (see at the end of this document 'Installation of PHP for IIS')
* Mark the location of *php-cgi.exe*

### Simple user

* Must be registered to upload/modify packages
* Can only edit the packages that he uploaded
* When an user upload for the first time a package with a certain id, then all versions will be owned by the same user. No other users but the administrators could modify or upload packages with the same id.
* The token available to access the API for the upload can be regenerated by any user. 
* The API token can be used with our without the curly braces.
* The users will see in their list of packages only the packages that they uploaded.

### For the administrators

* They can add/remove/enable users
* They can add/modify any package. When a package uploaded initially by another user is uploaded by the administrator, the ownership of the package will be kept the same.
* It is possible to download packages from external sources. It will be sufficent to insert the address from which the packages would be taken, specifying where should be put the identifier and the version of the package to download locally (through the @ID and @VERSION tags)
* When the database is corrupted it can be regenerated through "Refresh packages db from packages directory." mind that all the packages will become owned by the administrators.
* It would be possible to upload the packages directly on the 'db/packages' directory and then run the "Refresh packages db from packages directory.". All packages not yet present on the database will be loaded.

## The Api

The nuget API is based more or less on the OData protocol.
All of the api lsited that returns a collection support the usage of parameters 

* $skip: Optional. The number of items to skip. Default to 0.
* $top: Optional. The number of items returned. Default to 10.

### Api V1

* /api/v1: Retrieves the root for the entities that will be used by the API. No parameters.
* /api/v1/package/\[package-id\]/\[package-version\]: (GET) Download the specified package. No parameters.
* /api/v1/package/\[package-id\]/\[package-version\]?apiKey=xxx&setPrerelease: (POST) Set the package as listed.
	* apiKey: Mandatory. The api key of the user. Must match the one of the user that firstly inserted the package or the user must be Admin
	* setPrerelease: Optional. If present will set the package as release (without touching the listed flag) THIS IS SPECIFIC FOR phpnuget
* /api/v1/package/\[package-id\]/\[package-version\]?apiKey=xxx&setPrerelease: (DELETE) Set the package as not listed.
	* apiKey: Mandatory. The api key of the user. Must match the one of the user that firstly inserted the package or the user must be Admin
	* setPrerelease: Optional. If present will set the package as prerelease (without touching the listed flag) THIS IS SPECIFIC FOR phpnuget
* /api/v1/$metadata: Retrieves the OData metadata, the actions allowed and the entities specifications. No parameters.
* /api/v1/FindPackagesById(): Search for packages by id, returns all packages with a certain id ordered by version descending
	* Id: Mandatory parameter, specify the identifier of the package (e.g. Angular-UI-Router)
* /api/v1/FindPackagesById()/$count: Count all packages with a certain id ordered by version descending. Same parameters as 'FindPackagesById()'
* /api/v1/Search(): Search for packages satisfyng the query with a certain id ordered by version descending
	* $filter: Optional. The query that will be used for the search, see 'Daily usage' for the syntax
	* $orderby: Optional. List of fields for the order by. e.g. 'Id desc, Version, Author asc' will order by Id descending, then by Version ascending (the default) then by Author ascending.
	* searchTerm: Optional. Equivalent to write 'substringof(\'searchTerm\',Id) or substringof(\'searchTerm\',Name)'
	* targetFramework: Optional. Target framework required, the result will contain the matching packages and the ones without framework specified.
	* includePrerelease: Optional. If set to 'true' include event the prereleases (the ones with the flag set by hand on package editing or the ones with versions that contains alphabetic characters, e.g. 1.0.0.1 is not prerelease but 1.0.beta is)
* /api/v1/Search()/$count: Count all packages satisfyng the query. Same parameters as 'FindPackagesById()'
* /api/v1/Packages(): Same as Search()
* /api/v1/Packages()/$count: Same as Search()/$count

### Api V2

All v1 APIs are present, remind to replace the v1 in the previous section with v2!

* /api/v2/FindPackageById(): Same as FindPackagesById()
* /api/v2/GetUpdates(): Search for packages satisfyng the query with a certain id ordered by version descending
	* packageIds: Optional. Pipe (|) separated list of package ids
	* versions: Optional. Pipe (|) separated list of package versions, their position is matching with the ones in packageIds
	* targetFrameworks: Optional. Pipe (|) separated list of package target frameworks, their position is matching with the ones in packageIds. If the framework is not specified in the package then it will be returned anyway

	* includeAllVersions: Not supported yet
	* versionConstraints: Not supported yet
* /api/v2/GetUpdates()/$count: Count all packages satisfyng the query. Same parameters as 'FindPackagesById()'

### Api V3

As soon as the guys from nuget defines it.
Actually is work in progress, trying to follow the "working" example on nuget.org

## Installation of PHP for IIS

### Installation for IIS 8

Tested on Windows 8 pro X64 bit and Windows 8.1 pro X64

This guid is adapted from [iis.net](http://www.iis.net/learn/application-frameworks/install-and-configure-php-on-iis/using-php-manager-for-iis-to-setup-and-configure-php)

1. download [php for windows](http://windows.php.net/)
2. extract downloaded zip ( C:/php )
3. download [php manager[(http://phpmanager.codeplex.com/releases) for IIS ( its an extension  for managing PHP from IIS control panel )
4. open php manager and click on register new php installation
5. choose php-cgi.exe and click ok (usually is inside 'C:\Program Files (x86)\PHP\v5.3\php-cgi.exe')
6. now check phpinfo and choose error reporting
7. open your favorite code editor and type

<?php echo "Hello World !" ; ?>

and save this as hello.php ( or anything ) on c:inetpubwwwroot
and open http://localhost/hello.php

now IIS is serving PHP now in next tutorial i will show you how to set up MySQL in windows

### Features of PHP manger

* Register PHP with IIS
* Validate and properly configure existing PHP installations
